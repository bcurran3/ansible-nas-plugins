## NOTES FOR PLUGIN DEVELOPERS

How to standardize your repo:
* name your GitHub repo `ansible-nas-plugins'
* make a folder in your repo using your GitHub profile name
* make a README.md file describing your plugins inside your folder with your GitHub profile name
* make folders for each of your plugins and put your plugin there (it doesn't matter if they are tasks or roles, you'll have to define the path to them)
* make a REDME.MD file in each of your plugin folders with the plugin description and installation instructions
